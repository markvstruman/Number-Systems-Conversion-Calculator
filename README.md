# Number-Systems-Conversion-Calculator
Created as my AP Computer Science Principles create task application, I pushed myself to use textual Java - despite not being a requirement - to hone my skills at app development.

## User-Interface

## Demonstration of the Application

This is a demo video to show the functionality of the application.

## Purpose
I wrote this application - despite the option of using Scratch or an easier programming language for this project - to refine my skills in Java app development.
I used Processing, a very visual-focused Java IDE, as it allowed me to focus more on the design and architecture of my program's methods, and suited it's interactivity.
